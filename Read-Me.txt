NOTE
This model was created using publicly available data, publicly available
technical reports, textbooks, and guesses. It contains no proprietary or
restricted data. It has been validated only to the extent that it seems
to "fly right", and possibly to comply to published, publicly known, 
performance data (maximum speed, endurance, etc.). Thus, this model
is meant for educational and entertainment purposes only.
This simulation model is not endorsed by the manufacturer.
